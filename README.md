# Data-Science-Jobs-Salaries-Analysis
## Project Overview
Data is an important part that cannot be missed in the IT field. Data jobs have become more popular and are developing in the IT job market. There are three classical job titles for data that we've listened to: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and data scientist.<br/>
From this dataset, I want to research salaries among data jobs, analyzing the proportion of employees based on company location and experience level in 2 work years (2020 and 2021). Through this project, I want to perform insights about potential of data jobs.
## Data source
Data Science Jobs Salaries.csv : The main data set is used for this project<br/>
[Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/data-science-jobs-salaries)

## Tools
MS Excel : Data Cleaning<br/> 
PostgreSQL: Data Analysis<br/>
Power BI: Creating Report

## Process
### Data Cleaning/ Preperation
In the data cleaning process, I  use Ms Excel to perform this tasks:
- Data loading
- Adjusting inaccurate data and removing empty rows, duplicates
- Formatting data

### Data Analysis
I use PostgreSQL to extract information used to discover insights and create queries to answer key questions:
- How many employees do attend the review in each year 2020 and 2021 ?
- How is the proportion of working employees based on experience level ?
- What is the average salary among data job titles ?
### Data Visualization
Finally for visualizing all found data insights, I use Power BI to create charts.

### Results/Findings:
In the top 3 most popular data jobs, Data Engineer has the highest average salary of around 82.3K USD, followed by Data Scientist and Data Analyst.<br/>
According to experience level, the executive level has the highest average salary. A growth in the average salary at the executive level was seen from 2020 to 2021, whereas other experience levels from entry to senior witnessed a drop by 6-7K USD.<br/>
America and Germany seem to be potential locations where IT employees focus on. In comparison with other office jobs, IT has a more flexible workplace. More than 50 percentage of data employees work remotely, or hybrid working is also popular.<br/>
Full-time employees account for the highest proportion, while there are not many Freelancers.
### Uncover Insights:
The figure for middle-level employees working in the data field totaled 102 in both years, while entry-level employees comprise 11 employees. Acquiring a job position in the data field is competitive among entry-level employees. While most data jobs require, in addition to tech skills, experience in domain knowledge.<br/>
Especially the fields of data science and Machine Learning have a high average salary.
